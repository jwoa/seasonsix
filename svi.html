        <p>Throughout my undergrad experience at college I was always on my phone. Always documenting what was going on with me and my friends. So naturally they would always want to see the pictures but I didn’t use Flickr or anything at the time so they lived on my laptop, along with all the party videos. They must have asked to see my computer at least twice a day, so, I thought to myself . . . why not put my computer online for them? But not just a simple upload to a Dropbox. More like creating a website that looks like my desktop itself. Give them the whole experience so that way they can use it whenever I was not around.

        This project is more about nostalgia for me than anything else. Sort of a time capsule for all our years spent together in undergrad. A place that will live forever in our memory and now online as well. Well, to an extent. I'm building this site using services such as Flickr and Vimeo to host the content and I'm going to create all the desktop interactions using javascript.
