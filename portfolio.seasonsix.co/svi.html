                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Throughout my undergrad experience at college I was always on my phone. Always documenting what was going on with me and my friends. So naturally they would always want to see the pictures but I didnâ€™t use Flickr or anything at the time so they lived on my laptop, along with all the party videos. They must have asked to see my computer at least twice a day, so, I thought to myself . . . why not put my computer online for them? But not just a simple upload to a Dropbox. More like creating a website that looks like my desktop itself. Give them the whole experience so that way they can use it whenever I was not around.

                    <h3> Planning <span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></h3>
                    <p>The whole site was to look like my desktop except with a few changes, such as the configuration of the top bar. Starting off with some sketches I came up with an idea of how I wanted it to look and how I wanted the user to interact with it. I kept the look relatively simple while using images from my own desktop and screenshots to create the experience for them.</p>

                    <br />
                    <li>The home page shows a different gif on every reload.</li>
                    <li>The about page has some text about us in a text editor.</li>
                    <li>The gallery page links to a blog in an iframe so the consistency is not lost.</li>
                    <li>The shop is displayed in a google chrome browser that can stretch and resize.</li>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <p>This project involved a lot of javascript to make the elements on the page function like they would on the desktop. Including the ability to drag and resize some of the windows.</p>
