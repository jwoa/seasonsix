        <h4>Interaction Designer</h4>
        <p class="pj">Hey there, I’m Jason Agyekum and I’m a designer <span style="font-family: Arial;">+</span> developer who hopes to make cool and useful things for people. Although I started with only making websites I found that there were more possibilities to create greater things with interaction design and I’ve changed my path ever since.
            <br>
            <br>The great thing about interaction design is that it can applied to different mediums like websites, products, services etc. The possibilities are endless and I would love to further develop my skills so I can take them on.

                <br>-->
                <br>When you live with other people it’s important for you all to be on the same page. Although the App Store has numerous apps that help with living with someone there’s not one cohesive fun app to make everything simple.

                <br>Living with two of my best friends I realized how “clutch” it would be to have something that can take of everything and simplify our complications. So I decided to do something about it.</p>

            <p class="mp">Throughout my four years of undergraduate at UAlbany I would document a lot of the things that me and my friends did. They always wanted to reminisce and I don’t blame them. So instead of always giving them my laptop I figured I’d give them a cool way to view the photos and “use my computer” rather than just send them a Flickr link.</p>

            <h3>D.I.Y Religion</h3>
            <p class="mp">One of my best friends, Jamal (Mally), once spoke to me about how we all follow the same path and engage in certain social experiences depending on where we live. But, because of perspective we all experience things differently. This whole idea of following the same path and viewing things differently led my mind to religion. A construct with numerous similarities across all variations and a shared goal of peace, love, and respect for others as well as God. Yet it is the cause of millions of deaths and wars. This projects looks into it.</p>

            <p class="mp">I was going through, actually I am still in it, a phase of trying to eat healthy and more organic products. However, I had not done any real research into the matter, I just thought that eating fruits and cutting out the junk would work. After looking into where my fruits were coming from and what was actually in most of them I decided to make a statement with it. </p>
