        <h2 class="project_title">3 SCREEN "MODULE"</h2>
        <li class="status in-progress">in development</li>
        <p>I just want to make it clear that the name 3 Screen Module may not be technically correct, I just really liked how it sounded so it will most likely change. This “installation” will live on a webpage and will be activated and manipulated through the users eyes and the webcam. The idea is to serve the content that we usually consume but in a different way, one that allows the creative content to show the main piece with supporting information on the side. Allowing the user to see the details without losing the main piece.  Ideally the goal is to immerse the user into the content that they’re watching from the comfort of their homes. Without having to travel to the theaters or use an expensive VR headset.</p>
        
        <h3>Precedent</h3>
        <p>The original inspiration for this idea came from Kanye West and his presentation of his film Cruel Summer. He debuted it back in 2012 at Cannes and was played in a seven-screen cinema. The film wasn’t shown anywhere else and its sense of exclusivity made it even more desired. I really wanted to see the movie and I had no idea what it was about but the concept and the presentation fascinated me. Due to this I wanted to find a way that I could bring this type of style to the web and to everyone.</p>

        <p>The band known as The Gorillaz recently released a music video that allows the user to pan around the screen and sort be a part of the experience. Although, as of writing this, the control is a bit glitchy and limiting the idea still works. It doesn’t use the webcam but it still allows the viewer to be a part of the experience and interact with the content in a non-traditional format.</p>

        <h2 class="project_title">Mockups</h2>
        <p>All three “screens” will play at the same time with the main screen being in the middle. The side screens will serve as a sort of guide for the content. The content on the sides can be used to add more to the video without taking away anything from the main screen, just providing extra content. (This will require the use of a web camera)</p>

        <h2 class="project_title">Prototyping</h2>
        <p>I was fortunate enough to come across a library called WebGazer.js that came out of the computer science department at Brown. According to their website:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <em>“WebGazer.js is an eye tracking library that uses common webcams to infer the eye-gaze locations of web visitors on a page in real time. The eye tracking model it contains self-calibrates by watching web visitors interact with the web page and trains a mapping between the features of the eye and positions on the screen. WebGazer.js is written entirely in JavaScript and with only a few lines of code can be integrated in any website that wishes to better understand their visitors and transform their user experience. WebGazer.js runs entirely in the client browser, so no video data needs to be sent to a server. WebGazer.js runs only if the user consents in giving access to their webcam.”</em>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Thankfully WebGazer does a lot of the legwork and would serve as an amazing base for me to build this project on. There's a lot of experimetation to be done and I'm hoping to be able to get in contact with the team behind this amazing project once I get some demos up and running. </p>
