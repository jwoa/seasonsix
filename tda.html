        <p>Project OASIS aims to serve as the bridge between people who reside in places which are deemed as food deserts/swamps and the healthy alternatives around them. Users will be able to input their location and get results ranging from the quality of food in their community, to cooking classes, community gardens, co-ops, and many more. Most importantly, they will have the option of drafting out a letter to their local representative to do something about the state of their community.</p>

            <p>It took me quite some time before settling on the purple colorway for the logo. Green is primarily representative of health and blue tends to be used throughout social media companies and for water so I went with purple. One that just simply appeals to me personally and doesn't associate with any health stigmas.</p>
            <p>Some other alternatives for the logo including fruit and vegetabke varitions. Some composed of a smooth font with an avacado pit to replace the O's etc but they all became too abstract and strayed away from the point.</p>

            <p>This has been the hardest part of the process so far honestly. Initially I wanted to have a one page design with the information displayed but the format became very cluttered when prototyping. So, after some revision I settled on a single page with tabs to display different pieces of information relative to the user.</p>
